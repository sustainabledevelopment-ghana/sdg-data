This guidance will show you how to manage data and metadata in Git Bash.
The methods below are faster and easier than the drag+drop or manual approaches,
although in some instances (e.g. first time uploading indicator metadata) it is best
to use manual entry as this will help guard against build errors in Travis CI.

All commands to be entered into the Git Bash terminal are marked with '##'.
This is just to make them stand out - don't include '##' when entering the command.

For guidance in setting up Git Bash, go to 'Git Bash setup.txt'.

Cloning a repository has 2 steps:
1. Set a working directory / project folder
2. Create a local version of the repository
Note: If you have already cloned the repo, skip this section.

Editing and pushing files has 3 steps:
1. Open the working directory
2. Make required changes to data/metadata/scripts
3. Push changes to the repository

-----------------

Cloning a repository

1. Set a working directory / project folder

Choose a location to save your cloned repository.
I recommend creating a folder in your C drive called 'repo',
and make a folder inside 'repo' for the project (i.e. GhanaSDG).

Open the 'Git Bash' terminal (search for it with the Windows buton), and then
set your working directory to the project folder using the 'cd' command:
## cd /c/repo/ghanasdg
## explorer .   (opens your working directory as a window)
Note: if you name it differently, just substitute '/c/repo/ghanasdg for your directory in the commands below.

2. Create a local version of the repository

Choose which repository to clone (sustainabledevelopment-Ghana/sdg-data contains the csvs and metadata).
https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-ghana/sdg-data

Use git clone " [SSH URL] " to make a local copy of the repo on your machine.
You can find the SSH URL in the main repo page in GitHub (green button 'Clone or download').
## ___________   (for Ghana sdg-data repository)
Note: You can press the 'up' key to show previous commands, and paste using SHIFT + INS.

In Git Bash you will see the download progressing (usually takes 15-60 seconds).
Update the directory (cd ./) to the new folder, which will be named after the repo.
## cd ./sdg-data

Job's a good'un! You have now cloned the repository.

-----------------

Editing and pushing files

1. Open the working directory

Open Git Bash and set the working directory to your repository (update the following as required).
## cd /c/repo/ghanasdg/sdg-data
## explorer .

2. Make required changes to data/metadata/scripts

Go ahead and make changes to the csvs ('data'), metadata ('meta') and so on.
When you are done, save the file. It will now be 'ahead' of the online repo.
You can also add, delete and move files and folders.
It's OK to create a folder for shared documents, etc - these won't display on the site.

You may also want to change the 'Readme' file to alter what displays on your repo page.
For changes to the site such as contact email, publications and other visual changes,
you will need to make a clone of the 'sdg-indicators' repo, saving it under 'ghanasdg'.

3. Push changes to the repository

To compare your local copy with the online site, use:
## git status

If this is as you expected. Proceed with the following:
## git add -A
## git clone -m "MESSAGE"   (enter name of the commit)
## git push

You will see the transfer occur, then your repo will update almost immediately.
Note that to see the changes on the website, you will have to do a 'Push to Live'.

If another user is also editing the repository, you may have the last step fail.
Try using 'git push -f' to force the commit. Be careful though.

Note: the NISR 'dlink' WiFi seems to have a security feature that prevents you cloning
or pushing changes. I suggest using an alternate network or ask your IT team to help.
